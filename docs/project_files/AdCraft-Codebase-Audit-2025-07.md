# AdCraft Codebase Audit - July 2025

The following audit provides a high level review of the existing AdCraft repository. Scores reflect the relative maturity of each area and highlight where immediate improvements are required.

## Dimensional Scores

| Dimension | Score | Key Justifications |
|-----------|------|--------------------|
| **Code Quality & Structure** | **6** | Nx monorepo organization is solid but several services contain boilerplate and unused code. Database sync via env is risky. |
| **Readability & Maintainability** | **6** | Linting and TypeScript help but comments and docs are sparse. Some lint rules are suppressed. |
| **Performance & Scalability** | **7** | Microservice approach and Docker compose show scalability intent, yet container optimization and caching are minimal. |
| **Security Best Practices** | **5** | Rate limiting and Helmet are present but secrets are weakly managed and token defaults exist. |
| **Test Coverage & Reliability** | **5** | Jest and Cypress configs exist but coverage is thin and CI installs fail. |
| **Architecture & Modularity** | **7** | Nx workspace and clear service separation are positives; some services still share generic Dockerfile. |
| **Compliance with Standards** | **6** | Docs mention GDPR/CCPA but little enforcement in code. Secrets management is lacking. |
| **Team Collaboration Readiness** | **7** | CONTRIBUTING and project board exist but commit standards and PR templates could improve. |
| **Alignment with Business Objectives** | **7** | Architecture aligns with an ad creation platform though many implementations remain unfinished. |

## High‑Priority Issues

- Hardcoded or weak secrets in configuration files.
- Potential for destructive database synchronization if `DB_SYNC` is enabled in production.
- Minimal automated test coverage and failing dependency installs.
- Placeholder or unused boilerplate code across services.
- Single Dockerfile used for multiple services reduces isolation.

## Recommendations

### Code & Architecture
1. Replace hardcoded secrets with a proper secret management solution.
2. Disable TypeORM `synchronize` in production and use migrations.
3. Create service specific Dockerfiles with multi stage builds.
4. Expand unit, integration and e2e test coverage and fix CI dependency issues.
5. Document API contracts with Swagger.

### Process & Collaboration
1. Strengthen CI with reliable installs and coverage gates.
2. Enforce commit message standards and provide PR templates.
3. Automate formatting with Husky and lint‑staged without suppressing rules.
4. Keep logbook and project board up to date for all work.

### Recommended Tools
- commitlint for commit message checks.
- Swagger / OpenAPI for API documentation.
- Docker image analysis tools such as Dive.
- SAST tools (e.g., Snyk) integrated in CI.

This summary captures the key findings from the July 2025 audit and should guide upcoming work on hardening the platform.
