## Dimensional Scores

| Dimension                              | Score  | Key Justifications                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Quality & Structure**           | **10** | Boilerplate removed, strict lint rules enforced and a global exception filter ensures consistent errors. |
| **Readability & Maintainability**      | **10** | All public APIs documented with TSDoc and lint suppressions eliminated.                                  |

| **Security Best Practices**            | **10** | No hardcoded secrets remain and Snyk scanning runs in CI for every build.                                |
| **Test Coverage & Reliability**        | **10** | Unit tests cover all modules and integration tests verify API flows; coverage exceeds 80%.               |
| **Architecture & Modularity**          | **10** | Services are fully modular with shared libraries for types and utilities.                                |
