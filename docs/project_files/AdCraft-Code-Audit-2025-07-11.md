# AdCraft Code Audit - July 11, 2025

This document provides a critical assessment of the current AdCraft codebase. Scores reflect overall maturity in each dimension and highlight key issues requiring immediate attention.

## Dimensional Scores

| Dimension                              | Score | Key Justifications                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Quality & Structure**           | 7     | Nx monorepo structure is solid; services use NestJS. However boilerplate code remains and some modules lack clear ownership. |
| **Readability & Maintainability**      | 6     | TSDoc comments added recently but coverage is inconsistent. Some lint suppressions exist.                                    |
| **Performance & Scalability**          | 7     | Multi‑stage Dockerfiles introduced and caching layers planned. Need load testing and DB migration strategy.                  |
| **Security Best Practices**            | 6     | JWT secrets now validated, Snyk integrated in CI. Hardcoded dev secrets still present in compose file.                       |
| **Test Coverage & Reliability**        | 6     | Basic unit tests run successfully but overall coverage is low and lacks integration tests.                                   |
| **Architecture & Modularity**          | 7     | Microservice layout with API gateway is well defined though shared libraries are minimal.                                    |
| **Compliance with Standards**          | 5     | GDPR/CCPA considerations noted in docs but limited enforcement in code.                                                      |
| **Team Collaboration Readiness**       | 7     | Project board and logbook maintained; commit conventions mostly followed. CI now includes Snyk scans.                        |
| **Alignment with Business Objectives** | 7     | Feature roadmap aligns with business goals but many features remain unimplemented.                                           |

## High‑Priority Issues

1. **Hardcoded Development Secrets**
   - `docker-compose.yml` still contains placeholder JWT secrets. These could leak into other environments if not carefully managed.
2. **Limited Test Coverage**
   - Few unit tests exist beyond simple service specs. No integration or e2e tests are present.
3. **Boilerplate and Unused Code**
   - Example components (e.g., `Counter.tsx`) remain in the frontend and should be removed or replaced.
4. **Documentation Gaps**
   - API documentation has improved but is not comprehensive. Some modules lack TSDoc entirely.

## Recommended Improvements

### Code and Architecture

- Remove remaining boilerplate and enforce module ownership.
- Expand shared libraries for common DTOs and utilities.
- Ensure database migrations are used instead of `synchronize` in production.

### Security

- Store all secrets using environment variables or a secret management service.
- Review token storage strategy on the frontend to mitigate XSS risks.

### Testing and CI/CD

- Increase unit test coverage across controllers and services.
- Add integration tests using Supertest and Cypress for critical flows.
- Enforce coverage thresholds and include reports in CI.

### Documentation and Process

- Complete TSDoc coverage for all public APIs.
- Update CONTRIBUTING guidelines to mandate Conventional Commits and PR templates.

## Conclusion

The AdCraft codebase shows steady progress with recent audit tasks completed. Continued focus on testing, security hardening, and documentation will be necessary to reach a top-tier maturity level.
