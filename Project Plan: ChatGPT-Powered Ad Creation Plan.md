Project Plan: AI-Powered Ad Creation Platform
This document outlines a step-by-step roadmap for building the HopeTheory Ad Creation App. Each phase is broken into key sprints, deliverables, and high‑level tasks. We’ll work together sprint by sprint—I’ll provide the code and guidance, and you’ll integrate and test.

Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture (Weeks 1–2)
Sprint 1.1: Project Setup & CI/CD - Initialize Git repo, branch structure (main, develop, feature/*) - Configure GitHub Actions for linting and test runs - Integrate Docker containers for development - Verify npm run dev, npm test workflows
Sprint 1.2: Authentication & User Management - Implement JWT/OAuth login & registration endpoints - Build signup/login UI in Next.js with form validation - Persist user data in PostgreSQL (users table) - Add session handling on frontend (Apollo context)
Deliverables: - Working dev environment with CI - User can register/login

Phase 2: Image Upload & Basic Editor (Weeks 3–5)
Sprint 2.1: Image Asset Pipeline - Backend: File upload endpoint → S3 bucket (or local storage) - Frontend: File-picker component → upload progress indicator - Database: Store image metadata (URL, dimensions, owner)
Sprint 2.2: Canvas & Editing Toolbar - Integrate a lightweight canvas library (e.g., Fabric.js) - Add controls: crop, rotate, resize - Real-time preview of edits
Sprint 2.3: Template System MVP - Define JSON schema for templates (layers, text positions) - Load sample templates into database - UI: Template picker, apply to canvas
Deliverables: - User can upload images, perform basic edits, and apply templates

Phase 3: Advanced AI Features & Publishing (Weeks 6–9)
Sprint 3.1: AI Background Removal - Integrate AWS Lambda / custom model for background removal - Frontend: one-click “Remove background” button - Update canvas layer handling
Sprint 3.2: Text Effects & Graphics Library - Font library integration (Google Fonts) - Text styling controls (shadow, outline) - Sticker/Icon picker with tag-based search
Sprint 3.3: Social Sharing & Export - Implement export endpoint (generate PNG/JPEG) - Integrate FB/IG/TikTok sharing SDKs - Add direct share buttons in UI
Deliverables: - AI-powered enhancement tools - One-click export & social sharing

Phase 4: Monetization & Team Collaboration (Weeks 10–12)
Sprint 4.1: Stripe Billing Integration - Define pricing tiers in Stripe - Protect premium routes with subscription checks - UI: Upgrade/downgrade flows, billing dashboard
Sprint 4.2: Team Workspaces & Analytics - Multi-user workspaces under one account - Save projects & shared editing - Basic analytics: export counts, views (stub data)
Deliverables: - Subscription payments live - Teams and analytics dashboards

Phase 5: QA, Performance & Launch Prep (Weeks 13–14)
End-to-end testing (Cypress)
Performance profiling & lazy loading
Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.2)
Security audit (OWASP Top 10)
Final bugfixes, documentation updates
Milestone: Public Beta release

Phase 6: Beta Feedback & Production Launch (Weeks 15–18)
Collect user feedback, triage issues
Release mobile apps (Android & iOS) via Expo
Finalize scaling plan (EKS/GPU containers)
Rollout marketing integrations (Daraz/Bikroy)
Milestone: v1.0 Production launch

Next Steps
Review Plan: Confirm timeline and priorities.

Sprint Kickoff: We’ll start Sprint 1.1 — setting up the repo and CI.

Code Delivery: I’ll provide code snippets and guidance; you’ll integrate and test locally.
Let me know if you’d like any adjustments before we begin with Sprint 1.1!
