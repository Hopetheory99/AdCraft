# Logbook Entry: SEC-001 - Add security middleware

**Date:** 2025-07-06
**Agent:** codex

## 1. Task
Harden auth-service by adding HTTP security headers and rate limiting.

## 2. Plan
- Integrate `helmet` middleware into NestJS bootstrap.
- Configure `express-rate-limit` with environment-driven options.
- Document new environment variables in the Implementation Guide.
- Update project board and tests.

## 3. Actions Taken
- Added `helmet` and `express-rate-limit` dependencies.
- Modified `auth-service` bootstrap to use Helmet and a rate limiter.
- Created environment variables `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` and `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` with defaults.
- Wrote integration test asserting the `x-dns-prefetch-control` header is present.

## 4. Outcome
Auth service now sets standard security headers and enforces rate limits, improving resilience against common attacks. Documentation updated.
