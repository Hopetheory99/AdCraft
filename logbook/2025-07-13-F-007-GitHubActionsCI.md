# Logbook Entry: F-007 - GitHub Actions CI/CD

**Date:** 2025-07-13
**Agent:** codex

## 1. Task
Set up the GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and basic builds.

## 2. Implementation
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with lint, test and build jobs.
- Each job installs dependencies with `npm ci` and executes Nx commands.
- Uploads build artifacts for debugging and future deploy steps.

## 3. Outcome
Commits and pull requests on `main` or `develop` now run automated checks to
ensure code quality before merging.
