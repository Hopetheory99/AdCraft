# Logbook Entry: MAINT-002 - Production Cleanup

**Date:** 2025-07-13
**Agent:** codex

## 1. Task
Prepare the codebase for production by tidying imports, removing `any` usage, and ensuring documentation reflects the latest improvements.

## 2. Plan
- Fix missing imports in `auth-service` bootstrap
- Eliminate remaining `any` types in gateway middleware and tests
- Update API gateway e2e tests for typed server
- Record task on the project board

## 3. Actions Taken
- Added `HttpExceptionFilter` and `loadAwsSecrets` imports in `main.ts`
- Introduced `AuthenticatedRequest` type to replace `(req as any)` in middleware
- Updated unit and e2e tests to avoid `any`
- Logged this work under MAINT-002 on the project board

## 4. Outcome
Code compiles locally but project tests require Nx packages. Lint now reports configuration issues due to ESLint v9 upgrade. Further setup is needed to run tests in this environment.
