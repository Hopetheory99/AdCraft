# DOCS-008 Codebase Testing Results

**Date:** 2025-07-15

## Summary
- Performed npm dependency installation to verify project setup.
- Attempted to run unit tests for `auth-service` via Nx.
- Documented failures and environment details for troubleshooting.

## Findings
1. `npm install` failed with an `ERESOLVE` dependency conflict around `react-redux` and `@types/react`.
2. `npx nx test auth-service --skip-nx-cache` prompted to install the Nx CLI, indicating it is not globally available by default.
3. Node.js `v20.19.2` and npm `11.4.2` are installed in the environment.

## Next Steps
- Install the Nx CLI globally (`npm install -g nx`) before running Nx commands.
- Resolve peer dependency issues or use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` until versions are aligned.
- Update documentation with these notes so contributors know how to run the tests locally.
