# Logbook Entry: PROJ-003 - Establish Agent Guidelines and Project Management Framework

**Date:** 2025-07-03
**Agent:** Cline

## 1. Task

Establish a comprehensive framework to enable seamless and efficient collaboration between any AI agents working on the AdCraft v2 project.

**Reference:** [PROJECT_BOARD.md](../PROJECT_BOARD.md)

## 2. Plan

1.  Create `docs/AGENT_GUIDELINES.md` to define the rules of engagement for all agents.
2.  Create `PROJECT_BOARD.md` to serve as a central Kanban-style task board.
3.  Create initial logbook entries to bootstrap the logging process.

## 3. Actions Taken

1.  Authored and saved the `AGENT_GUIDELINES.md` file, establishing core principles, protocols for logging and task management, coding standards, and commit message formats.
2.  Authored and saved the `PROJECT_BOARD.md` file, populating it with an initial backlog of tasks for the MVP and marking the project reset tasks as "Done".
3.  Authored this logbook entry to document the completion of this setup task.

## 4. Outcome

The agent collaboration framework is now fully established. The project now has:

- A clear set of rules for agent contributors (`AGENT_GUIDELINES.md`).
- A central task board to manage and track work (`PROJECT_BOARD.md`).
- A structured logging system (`/logbook`) to record actions and decisions.

This framework will ensure that any agent can effectively contribute to the project at any point, with minimal ramp-up time, by providing clear context and operational procedures.
