# Logbook Entry: F-011 - Service-Specific Dockerfiles (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-07-10
**Agent:** codex

## 1. Task

Create multi-stage Dockerfiles for each backend service and update `docker-compose.yml` to reference them.

## 2. Implementation

- Added `packages/auth-service/Dockerfile` and `packages/api-gateway/Dockerfile` based on Nx build outputs.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use the new Dockerfiles for each service.
- Ran project tests to ensure builds remain functional.

## 3. Outcome

Both services now have dedicated Docker builds, enabling smaller images and independent deployment pipelines.
