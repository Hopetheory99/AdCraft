## Implementation Summary
Created the initial project structure and configuration files to support the AdCraft platform development. This implementation establishes the foundation for the NX monorepo architecture, sets up development tooling, provides Docker configurations for containerization, and prepares the project for collaborative development.

## Technical Details
1. Created the following directory structure:
   ```
   AdCraft/
   ├── .github/             # GitHub configuration including CI/CD workflows
   ├── src/                 # Source code for frontend and backend
   │   ├── frontend/        # React frontend application
   │   └── backend/         # Backend microservices
   │       └── services/    # Individual microservices
   ├── docs/                # Technical documentation and MCP configurations
   ├── logbook/             # Systematic development log entries
   └── code-samples/        # Reference implementations
   ```

2. Added project configuration files:
   - `package.json`: Basic NX workspace configuration with dependencies
   - `nx.json`: NX workspace configuration with task runners and generators
   - `tsconfig.base.json`: TypeScript configuration with strict type checking
   - `.eslintrc.json`: ESLint configuration for code linting
   - `.prettierrc`: Prettier configuration for code formatting
   - `.gitignore`: Configured to exclude build artifacts, dependencies, etc.

3. Implemented CI/CD configuration:
   - GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration
   - Pipeline steps for linting, testing, and building

4. Created Docker configuration:
   - `docker-compose.yml`: Multi-service configuration for local development
   - `Dockerfile.frontend`: Multi-stage build for React frontend
   - `Dockerfile.backend`: Multi-stage build for NestJS microservices
   - `nginx.conf`: Nginx configuration for frontend serving and API proxying

5. Added project documentation:
   - Updated README.md with project overview
   - Created CONTRIBUTING.md with developer guidelines
   - Created AdCraft-Documentation-Index.md to organize documentation
   - Created MCP server configurations for context7 and sequential-thinking

6. Added code samples:
   - Authentication service sample with JWT implementation

## Testing Approach
- Verified directory structure creation
- Validated configuration files syntax
- Confirmed Docker configuration is aligned with the microservices architecture
- Checked CI/CD workflow configuration against GitHub Actions standards

## Issues and Resolutions
- TypeScript errors in code samples are expected as they're only reference implementations and not part of the active codebase
- Docker configuration will need environment-specific variables for production deployment

## Acceptance Criteria Verification
1. ✅ Project structure created that supports microservices architecture
2. ✅ Configuration files set up for development tooling (ESLint, Prettier)
3. ✅ Docker configuration for containerized development
4. ✅ CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions
5. ✅ Documentation updated and organized
6. ✅ MCP server configurations created

## Documentation Updates
- README.md updated with project overview and getting started instructions
- Created new AdCraft-Documentation-Index.md as the central documentation index
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed guidelines for contributors
- Added MCP server configurations for improved AI assistance

## Next Steps
- Implement NX monorepo initialization (Task F-001)
- Set up React frontend application (Task F-002)
- Set up NestJS backend services structure (Task F-003)
- Complete Git repository configuration (Task F-004)
