# Logbook Entry: F-012 - Implement Global Exception Filter (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-07-10
**Agent:** codex

## 1. Task
Finalize the HTTP exception filter for NestJS services and ensure it is applied globally with tests validating the response format.

## 2. Implementation
- Registered `HttpExceptionFilter` globally in the auth service bootstrap and in unit tests.
- Updated `auth.controller.spec.ts` to verify standardized error responses when service methods throw exceptions.

## 3. Outcome
Error handling across the auth service now produces consistent JSON output and tests reflect this behavior.
