## 1. Task
Set up the docker-compose environment including the API gateway and auth service.

## 2. Implementation
- Added `api-gateway` service in `docker-compose.yml` with correct project paths.
- Updated `auth-service` paths and port variable usage.
- Added `PORT_GATEWAY` and `GATEWAY_ENV_PATH` examples to `.env.example`.
- Documented enabling the gateway service in the Implementation Guide.

## 3. Outcome
Docker Compose now starts the API gateway alongside other services for local development.
