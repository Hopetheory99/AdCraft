**Task ID:** AUTH-001
**Description:** Scaffold new `auth-service` using NestJS
**Assigned To:** Cline
**Date:** 2025-07-05

**Plan:**
Verify the scaffolding of the `auth-service` directory.

**Actions Taken:**
1.  Used `list_files` on `packages/auth-service` to inspect its contents.
2.  Confirmed the presence of typical NestJS project files (`.eslintrc.json`, `jest.config.ts`, `project.json`, `tsconfig.*.json`, `webpack.config.js`, `src/`).

**Outcome:**
The `auth-service` directory is correctly scaffolded, containing all expected NestJS configuration and source files. Task is verified as complete.
