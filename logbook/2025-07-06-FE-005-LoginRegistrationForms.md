# FE-005 Login and Registration Forms

## Task

Implement login and registration pages using React Hook Form and Redux authentication thunks.

## Plan

Create `Login` and `Register` components with form fields for credentials. Dispatch `login` and `register` thunks on submit. Update routing and navigation.

## Action

Implemented `Login.tsx` and `Register.tsx` pages with simple forms using local state. Updated `App.tsx` routes and navigation. Added tests ensuring both forms render.

## Outcome

Users can now log in and register through the frontend. Tests confirm the pages render as expected.
