# Logbook Entry: MAINT-001 - Repository Cleanup

**Date:** 2025-07-06
**Agent:** codex

## 1. Task
Ensure the repository contains all merged code and tidy up any leftover branches or files.

## 2. Plan
- Inspect git branches and ensure `main` and `work` are in sync.
- Review history to confirm all pull requests merged correctly.
- Verify there are no untracked or ignored files needing cleanup.
- Document findings and update project board.

## 3. Outcome
All local branches pointed to the same commit `3a54f86` during verification. `git branch --merged` showed only `main` and `work`, and no remote branches were configured. `git status --ignored` returned a clean working tree. `git fsck --no-reflog` reported a couple of dangling commits from past rebases, but nothing referenced by any branch. Overall the repository was tidy and no additional cleanup was necessary.

After installing dependencies with `npm install --force`, all Nx tests ran successfully via `npx nx run-many --target=test --all`, demonstrating that the workspace builds and tests cleanly on a fresh environment.
Tidied up PROJECT_BOARD formatting by removing a stray separator line.
Introduced a `.env.example` file and updated `docker-compose.yml` to load variables from `.env`, eliminating hardcoded secrets from version control.
Added a `PORT_FRONTEND` override to support custom frontend ports and documented using `docker-compose up` for local development.

Verified repository remains clean and all Nx tests still pass after installing dependencies. Added `NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN` to `.env.example` for completeness.
