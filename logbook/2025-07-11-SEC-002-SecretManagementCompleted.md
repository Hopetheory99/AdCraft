# Logbook Entry: SEC-002 - Secret Management Cleanup (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-07-11
**Agent:** codex

## 1. Task

Remove all fallback secrets from the codebase and require environment configuration for JWT operations.

## 2. Implementation

- Refactored `AuthService.refresh` to throw an error if no JWT secret is configured rather than using the default `'secret'` value.
- Installed project dependencies and ran full test suite to verify functionality.

## 3. Outcome

Hardcoded secrets have been eliminated from runtime code, enforcing proper secret management across the services.
