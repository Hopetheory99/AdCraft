**Agent:** codex

## 1. Task
Implement secure user registration using bcrypt hashing.

## 2. Plan
- Add `bcryptjs`, `class-validator`, and `class-transformer` dependencies.
- Create registration DTO, service, and controller.
- Hash passwords before storing.
- Update docs and project board.
- Write unit tests for registration.

## 3. Actions Taken
- Added dependencies and updated `PROJECT_BOARD.md` to mark task in progress.
- Implemented `AuthService` and `AuthController` for `/auth/register` endpoint.
- Added `RegisterDto` with validation rules.
- Updated `AppModule` to include new providers and repository injection.
- Wrote unit tests verifying password hashing.
- Updated `backend-services.md` to reflect NestJS implementation.

## 4. Outcome
User registration endpoint now creates users with hashed passwords. Unit tests pass and documentation reflects current architecture.
