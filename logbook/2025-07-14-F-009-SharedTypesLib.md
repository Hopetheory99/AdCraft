# Logbook Entry: F-009 - Shared Types Library

**Date:** 2025-07-14
**Agent:** codex

## 1. Task
Create a shared Nx library for cross-service TypeScript models.

## 2. Implementation
- Added `libs/shared-types` with a basic `PublicUser` interface and project configuration.
- Updated `auth-service` to consume `PublicUser` from the library.

## 3. Outcome
Common types can now be imported across services, reducing duplication and improving consistency.
