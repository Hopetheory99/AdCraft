# Logbook Entry: F-006 - ESLint and Prettier Hook

**Date:** 2025-07-12
**Agent:** codex

## 1. Task
Configure ESLint and Prettier tooling with a pre-commit hook.

## 2. Implementation
- Created `.husky/pre-commit` to run `lint-staged` automatically.
- Added the `.husky` directory to version control for consistent setup.

## 3. Outcome
Pre-commit checks now enforce code formatting and lint rules before commits, ensuring consistent code style.
