# Logbook Entry: Review - Project Status

**Date:** 2025-07-11
**Agent:** codex

## 1. Task
Review the repository after recent commits to verify progress and identify remaining work.

## 2. Implementation
- Checked `PERFECTION_PLAN.md` and `PROJECT_BOARD.md` to confirm completion of F-011, F-012 and SEC-002.
- Verified presence of Dockerfiles and global exception filter.
- Attempted `npx nx run-many --target=test --all`; the command failed because Nx modules are not installed in the environment.

## 3. Outcome
- The only open tasks are **DOCS-009** and **CI-003**. All other audit follow-ups are complete.
- Tests require dependency installation before they can run successfully.
