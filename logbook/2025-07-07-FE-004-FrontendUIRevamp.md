## 1. Task
Introduce a modern UI foundation for the React frontend.

## 2. Implementation
- Added Material UI as the component library and theme provider.
- Replaced the Nx welcome page with a responsive home page and navigation bar.
- Created `NavBar` and `HomePage` components and wired them in `App.tsx`.
- Updated unit and e2e tests to reflect the new layout.

## 3. Outcome
The frontend now boots with a clean Material UI theme and an initial home page titled "Welcome to AdCraft". All tests continue to pass after the update.
