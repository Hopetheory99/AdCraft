## 1. Task
Remove hardcoded secrets and enforce secret management using AWS Secrets Manager.

## 2. Plan
- Research AWS Secrets Manager integration.
- Update service startup to fetch secrets from AWS.
- Pass AWS configuration via docker-compose.
- Document setup and update project board.

## 3. Actions Taken
- Added `loadAwsSecrets` utility and invoked it in `auth-service` bootstrap.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to provide `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_SECRET_ID`.
- Included new variables in `.env.example` and documented usage in the development setup guide.
- Created unit test for secret loading logic.

## 4. Outcome
Secrets are now loaded from AWS Secrets Manager at runtime, enabling secure configuration without storing credentials locally.
