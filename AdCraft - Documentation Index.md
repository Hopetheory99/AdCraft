## Getting Started

For new team members joining the AdCraft project, we recommend reviewing the documentation in this order:

1. **Project Managers**: Start with the AdCreationApp_Documentation.md, then review the Comprehensive Project Plan and Development Roadmap.

2. **Developers**:
   - Begin with AdCreationApp_Documentation.md for context
   - Review the Technical Architecture document
   - Follow the Implementation Guide to set up your development environment
   - Refer to the Testing Strategy when writing code

3. **QA Specialists**:
   - Start with the Testing Strategy document
   - Reference the Technical Architecture for system understanding
   - Use the User Guide to understand expected behaviors

4. **Designers and UX Specialists**:
   - Begin with the User Guide to understand the end-user experience
   - Review the AdCreationApp_Documentation.md for design requirements

## Document Maintenance

All documentation should be kept up-to-date as the project evolves. The responsibility for maintaining each document is as follows:

- **AdCreationApp_Documentation.md**: Product Manager
