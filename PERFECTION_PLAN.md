# AdCraft Perfection Plan

This document outlines concrete steps to elevate the AdCraft codebase to a 10/10 score across all quality dimensions.

## 1. Code Quality & Structure
- Enforce strict TypeScript rules (no implicit any, strictNullChecks).
- Adopt an opinionated lint configuration (ESLint + Prettier) with no overrides.
- Introduce Nx generators for scaffolding services and libs consistently.
- Remove boilerplate code and unused files from all packages.

## 2. Readability & Maintainability
- Document every public API using TSDoc/Swagger annotations.
- Establish a clean import strategy with path aliases.
- Add inline comments for complex logic and link to design docs.
- Keep changelog and project board updated for every feature.

## 3. Performance & Scalability
- Implement caching layers (Redis) for read-heavy endpoints.
- Use TypeORM migrations instead of `synchronize` in production.
- Add load tests (k6) and benchmark results to CI.
- Containerize services with multi‑stage Docker builds and minimal base images.

## 4. Security Best Practices
- Remove all hardcoded secrets; use `.env` for local dev and secret managers in prod.
- Implement Passport JWT strategy with access & refresh tokens.
- Apply rate limiting and helmet globally in gateway and services.
- Schedule regular dependency scans (Snyk) and security audits.

## 5. Test Coverage & Reliability
- Require unit tests for all modules using Jest.
- Add integration tests (Supertest) for API routes.
- Expand Cypress e2e tests for critical flows.
- Enforce coverage thresholds (80%+) in CI.

## 6. Architecture & Modularity
- Break out shared types and utilities into dedicated Nx libraries.
- Define service contracts using OpenAPI and generate typed clients.
- Employ message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) for asynchronous tasks.
- Set up observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana) for metrics and logs.

## 7. Standards Compliance
- Integrate accessibility linting (`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`).
- Document GDPR/CCPA handling and automate data retention policies.
- Include automated license checks for dependencies.

## 8. Team Collaboration
- Enforce Conventional Commits with commitlint.
- Provide PR templates requiring tests, docs, and issue references.
- Maintain an up‑to‑date CONTRIBUTING guide and on‑boarding docs.
- Use Nx Cloud for remote caching and distributed builds.

## 9. Business Alignment
- Map features to product OKRs in the project board.
- Define MVP scope clearly and track progress in weekly demos.
- Schedule quarterly architecture reviews to realign priorities.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Immediate (Weeks 1‑2)**
   - Set up CI/CD with lint, test, coverage, and Snyk scans.
   - Migrate secrets to environment variables or secret manager.
   - Document local setup prerequisites: install the Nx CLI globally and run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if dependency conflicts occur.
   - Remove obsolete code and document current service APIs.
2. **Short Term (Weeks 3‑6)**
   - Implement JWT Passport strategy across services.
   - Add integration and e2e tests with coverage enforcement.
   - Containerize with multi‑stage builds and optimize Dockerfiles.
3. **Mid Term (Weeks 7‑12)**
   - Introduce message queue and async processing where needed.
   - Build shared Nx libraries and refactor services to use them.
   - Launch comprehensive performance benchmarks and tuning.
4. **Long Term (Months 4+)**
   - Expand observability stack and automated compliance checks.
   - Continuously improve documentation and onboarding materials.
   - Revisit architecture for scaling based on real usage metrics.

By following this roadmap, AdCraft can achieve top-tier quality, security, and maintainability, positioning the project for sustainable growth.

## 10/10 Success Criteria

These benchmarks define what "perfect" looks like. Meeting them in full will yield a top rating across all audit dimensions.

1. **Code Quality & Structure**
   - Zero `any` usage and no lint warnings.
2. **Readability & Maintainability**
   - Public APIs fully documented with Swagger and TSDoc.
   - Project board and changelog updated for each merge. *(Tasks DOCS-001, PROJ-003)*
3. **Performance & Scalability**
   - Production builds use multi‑stage Dockerfiles.
   - Load tests validate throughput goals set in the roadmap. *(Tasks CI-001, CI-002)*
4. **Security Best Practices**
   - No secrets committed; JWT flow implemented with refresh tokens. *(Tasks SEC-001, AUTH-006)*
   - Automated dependency scanning in CI.
5. **Test Coverage & Reliability**
   - 80%+ coverage for unit and integration tests, enforced in CI. *(Tasks AUTH-006, CI-002)*
6. **Architecture & Modularity**
   - Shared types extracted to libraries with clear versioning. *(Task F-009)*
   - Message queue used for asynchronous jobs where appropriate.
7. **Standards Compliance**
   - Accessibility and license checks integrated in the build. *(Task DOCS-004)*
8. **Team Collaboration**
   - Conventional Commits verified via commitlint hook and PR template. *(Tasks PROJ-003, CI-002)*
9. **Business Alignment**
   - Features mapped to OKRs with quarterly reviews logged in the board.

## Continuous Improvement

- Run a quarterly codebase audit following the format of `AdCraft-Codebase-Audit-2025-07.md`.
- Update this plan whenever a new audit exposes gaps or when business objectives shift.

## Plan Maintenance Guidelines

- Keep `PROJECT_BOARD.md` in sync with this plan. Every action item must reference a task ID.
- Record task outcomes in the `/logbook` using the standardized entry format.
- Review success criteria after each audit and adjust tasks accordingly.
