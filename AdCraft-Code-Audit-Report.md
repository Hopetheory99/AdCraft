# AdCraft V2 - Code Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-07-03
**Auditor:** Cline (Principal Engineer)

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a critical, in-depth audit of the AdCraft V2 codebase. The assessment covers multiple dimensions, from code quality and architecture to security and team readiness. The findings are intended to provide CTO-level visibility into the current state of the project, highlighting both strengths and critical areas for improvement.

**Overall Score: 3/10**

The project is in a very early stage, and while some foundational elements are in place, there are significant gaps in implementation, testing, and documentation. The current score reflects the nascent state of the codebase and the substantial work required to bring it to a production-ready level.

## 2. Detailed Assessment

### 2.1. Code Quality and Structure

**Score: 4/10**

**Justification:**

- The project structure is based on Nx, which is a good choice for monorepos.
- The code is written in TypeScript, which is a good choice for type safety.
- The use of Prettier and ESLint is a good practice for maintaining code style.
- However, the codebase is very minimal, and there is not much to assess.
- The `auth-service` is scaffolded but has no business logic.
- The `frontend` is not yet implemented.

**Issues:**

- The codebase is too new to have any significant quality issues, but it also lacks any substantial implementation.

**Recommendations:**

- Enforce strict linting rules to maintain code quality as the project grows.
- Implement a peer-review process to ensure code quality.

### 2.2. Readability and Maintainability

**Score: 5/10**

**Justification:**

- The code is generally readable, but this is mainly due to its simplicity.
- The use of consistent naming conventions is a good practice.

**Issues:**

- The lack of comments and documentation makes it difficult to understand the intent of the code.

**Recommendations:**

- Add JSDoc comments to all functions and classes to improve readability.
- Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with guidelines for developers.

### 2.3. Performance and Scalability

**Score: 2/10**

**Justification:**

- The project is not yet in a state where performance can be assessed.
- The use of NestJS and TypeORM provides a good foundation for a scalable application, but the implementation is not yet complete.

**Issues:**

- No performance testing has been done.
- The database schema is very simple and may not be scalable.

**Recommendations:**

- Implement performance testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Design a more scalable database schema.

### 2.4. Security Best Practices

**Score: 3/10**

**Justification:**

- The use of environment variables for database credentials is a good practice.
- The `.gitignore` file is well-configured to prevent sensitive information from being committed.

**Issues:**

- The `auth-service` does not yet implement password hashing or JWT generation.
- There is no input validation in the `auth-service`.

**Recommendations:**

- Implement password hashing using bcrypt.
- Implement JWT generation for authentication.
- Implement input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities.

### 2.5. Test Coverage and Reliability

**Score: 1/10**

**Justification:**

- The project has a testing framework set up (Jest and Cypress), but there are no meaningful tests.
- The `auth-service-e2e` tests are just placeholders.

**Issues:**

- The lack of tests makes it impossible to ensure the reliability of the code.

**Recommendations:**

- Write unit tests for all services and components.
- Write end-to-end tests for all user flows.
- Aim for a test coverage of at least 80%.

### 2.6. Architecture and Modularity

**Score: 4/10**

**Justification:**

- The use of a monorepo with separate packages for different services is a good architectural choice.
- The `auth-service` is a good example of a modular service.

**Issues:**

- The project is still in its early stages, and the overall architecture is not yet clear.

**Recommendations:**

- Create a clear architectural diagram for the project.
- Define the responsibilities of each service and the communication between them.

### 2.7. Compliance with Industry and Domain-Specific Standards

**Score: N/A**

**Justification:**

- The project is too early in its development to assess compliance with industry standards.

### 2.8. Team Collaboration Readiness

**Score: 3/10**

**Justification:**

- The use of a project board is a good practice for team collaboration.
- The `README.md` file provides some basic information about the project.

**Issues:**

- The lack of a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file makes it difficult for new developers to get started.
- The commit messages are not standardized.

**Recommendations:**

- Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with clear guidelines for developers.
- Enforce a standard for commit messages (e.g., Conventional Commits).

### 2.9. Alignment with Business Objectives and Product Requirements

**Score: 2/10**

**Justification:**

- The project board provides a high-level overview of the tasks, but it lacks detailed product requirements.

**Issues:**

- It is not clear how the current state of the project aligns with the business objectives.

**Recommendations:**

- Create detailed user stories and acceptance criteria for each task.
- Ensure that the development team has a clear understanding of the business objectives.

## 3. High-Priority Issues and Technical Debt

1.  **Lack of Test Coverage:** The absence of a robust testing suite is the most critical issue. It introduces significant risk and will impede future development.
2.  **Incomplete Authentication and Authorization:** The `auth-service` is a critical component, but it is far from complete.
3.  **No Frontend Implementation:** The project is not usable without a frontend.
4.  **Lack of Documentation:** The project lacks the necessary documentation to enable effective team collaboration.

---

## 4. Concrete Improvements

### Code-Level

- **Implement User Entity:** The `User` entity in the `auth-service` should be completed with all necessary fields and relationships.
- **Implement Password Hashing:** Use `bcrypt` to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
- **Implement JWT Generation:** Generate a JWT upon successful login.

### Architectural

- **API Gateway:** Implement an API gateway to act as a single entry point for all client requests.
- **Service Discovery:** Implement a service discovery mechanism to allow services to find and communicate with each other.

### Process-Wise

- **Peer Reviews:** Enforce a mandatory peer-review process for all code changes.
- **Automated Testing:** Integrate automated testing into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Documentation:** Make documentation a part of the development process.

## 5. Recommended Tools, Patterns, or Practices

- **Conventional Commits:** Enforce the Conventional Commits specification for all commit messages.
- **Storybook:** Use Storybook for developing and documenting UI components.
- **Docker Compose:** Use Docker Compose to orchestrate the services in a local development environment.
- **SonarQube:** Use SonarQube for continuous code quality inspection.
